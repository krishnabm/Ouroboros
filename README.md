# üêç Ouroboros

Ouroboros is my submission to GMTK Game Jam 2025. 

**Game submission page [here](https://peak-dev.itch.io/ouroboros)**

## GMTK 2025
The theme of this jam is L‚ôæÔ∏èps.
Games with any abstract or tangible idea of loops.

## Ideaboard
#### Ouroboros snake game ‚úÖ
Classic snake with a twist, you can only chomp down on your tail, but doing so lets you eat the food within the loop.

#### Serpent of time
The snake battles hordes of enemies, except looping perfectly rewinds time buying you precious space and lost health. Scrapped due to vagueness

## Core mechanics
1. Ouroboros loops around and can only eat its tail, no other collisions allowed.
2. When forming a perfect loop, Ouroboros will turn reddish to indicate all food within will be consumed.
3. Food spawn randomly and will grant score. Effectively making this a score chasing game.
4. Ouroboros can only move in arcs, hitting ‚¨ÖÔ∏è or ‚û°Ô∏è will change the arc direction and center Ouroboros moves around.

## Pinch of salt üßÇ
This project was developed in little over 24 hours and is in no way the paragon of best practices.
This project is for posterity and I might improve it down the line. As it stands there will be little development on it.

## ü´Ç Credits
Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è using Godot.
